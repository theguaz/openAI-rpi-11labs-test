A gentle soul with pets alight.
Two cats of brown, with eyes so keen,
Sit and are held, in comfort, it's seen.

One striped, one dark with stately air.
They sit by door of lavender hue,
Under skies so crisp and blue.

One striped, one dark with starkly contrasting run.

Like sentries they wait by the door, silent decree.

A living picture, soft and sweet.

Beside a window framed with white it lies,
Gazing out yonder with its sharp, keen eyes.

A moment of peace, a kindhearted deed.
